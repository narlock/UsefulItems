# UsefulItems
There are a small amount of different items and blocks within Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 compared to the modern version of the game. UsefulItems is a server-side plugin for Craftbukkit to give more use to different items.

### Golden Tools
In my experience playing any version of Minecraft, I have rarely crafted tools with Gold. The main reason for this is that they break easily and provide little value when compared to even the cheaper, Stone pickaxe. That and Iron and Diamond tools are usually the preferred anyways. This plugin hopes to provide special abilities to these tools, encouraging players to craft them, despite their durability remaining the same.

#### "Decrafters"

Gold tools will now serve as "decrafters" in the sense that when they break a block that has been "crafted", a "decrafted" variant will be dropped instead of that block (with some reason, for example, we aren't going to shape a wood plank back into a log). The list includes:
- Dispenser -> 7 Cobblestone, 1 Bow, 1 Redstone Dust (when a Gold Pickaxe is used)
- Sandstone -> 4 Sand (when a Gold Pickaxe is used)
- Noteblock -> 8 Planks, 1 Redstone Dust (when a Gold Axe is used)
- Bed -> 3 Wool, 3 Planks (when a Gold Axe is used)
- Sticky Piston -> 1 Piston, 1 Slimeball (when a Gold Axe is used)
- Piston -> 3 Planks, 4 Cobblestone, 1 Iron Ingot, 1 Redstone Dust (when a Gold Axe is used)
- Workbench -> 4 Planks (when a Gold Axe is used)
- Furnace -> 8 Cobblestone (when a Gold Pickaxe is used)
- Redstone Torch -> 1 Redstone Dust, 1 Stick (when a Gold Axe is used)
- Door -> 6 Planks (when a Gold Axe is used)
- Lever -> 1 Stick, 1 Cobblestone (when a Gold Axe is used)
- Pressure Plate (Stone) -> 2 Stone (when a Gold Pickaxe is used)
- Iron Door -> 6 Iron Ingots (when a Gold Pickaxe is used)
- Pressure Plate (Wood) -> 2 Planks (when a Gold Axe is used)
- Button -> 2 Stone (when a Gold Pickaxe is used)
- Jukebox -> 8 Planks, 1 Diamond (when a Gold Axe is used)
- Jack 'o' Lantern -> 1 Pumpkin, 1 Torch (when a Gold Axe is used)
- Trapdoor* -> 3 Planks (when a Gold Axe is used)
- Sign -> 6 Planks, 1 Stick (when a Gold Axe is used)
- Redstone Repeater -> 3 Stone, 2 Redstone Torches, 1 Redstone Dust (when a Gold Pickaxe is used)

Might have to test if possible:
- Minecart -> 5 Iron Ingots (when a Gold Pickaxe is used)
- Painting -> 8 Sticks, 1 Wool (when a Gold Sword is used)

**Exclusions:**
1. Any craftable item that returns more than one of the crafted item. (ex: crafting torches with 1 stick and 1 coal will give 4 torches) *exception to this includes the trap door, as there is an even divisible amount for a trap door = 3 planks.
2. Items where a "decraft" option is already available: Gold/Iron/Diamond blocks.
2. Brick Blocks are excluded because there is nothing else in the game you can do with Bricks except for craft Brick Blocks.
